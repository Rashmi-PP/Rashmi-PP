**Hello	:wave::wave::wave:, I am Rashmi Nambiar Pappinisseri Puthenveettil (you can call me Rashmi)**   :grinning:

:large_blue_circle: I work as a data analyst at The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, Ohio, United States. I work on geospatial images :earth_americas: that are fed into one of our machine learning models. This helps our small business indemnity team better implement their responsibilities in terms of analyzing potential damages to roof structures and quantify the premiums. This also helps with claims underwriting.	:sunglasses:

:large_blue_circle: I graduated :woman_student: from Northeastern University, Boston, MA with a master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering (DAE). My interest in this field boomed only after I learnt about why it is relevant and going to be so for as long as companies exist and utilize data to make business decisions.

:large_blue_circle: My LinkedIn profile can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmipp/ Here, you can find some of the certifications that I completed, that expose my interest in the undertaken pursuit.

:large_blue_circle: Now, let me take you through some of the projects that I did while exploring the domain of data science.	:flashlight::chart_with_upwards_trend:
