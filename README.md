**Hello, I am Rashmi Nambiar Pappinisseri Puthenveettil (you can call me Rashmi)**  :grinning:

I currently work as a data analyst at The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, Ohio, United States. I work on geospatial images for the machine learning model. This helps our small business indemnity team better implement their responsibilities in terms of analyzing potential damages to roof structures and quantify the premiums. This also helps with claims underwriting.	:sunglasses:
