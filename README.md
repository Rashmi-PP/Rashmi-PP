**Hello	:wave::wave::wave:, I am Rashmi Nambiar Pappinisseri Puthenveettil (you can call me Rashmi)**   :grinning:

:large_blue_circle: I work as a data analyst at The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, Ohio, United States. I work on geospatial images :earth_americas: that are fed into one of our machine learning models. This helps our small business indemnity team better implement their responsibilities in terms of analyzing potential damages to roof structures and quantify the premiums. This also helps with claims underwriting.	:sunglasses:

:large_blue_circle: I graduated :woman_student: from Northeastern University, Boston, MA with a master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering (DAE). My interest in this field boomed only after I learnt about why it is relevant and going to be so for as long as companies exist and utilize data to make business decisions.

:large_blue_circle: My LinkedIn profile can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmipp/ Here, you can find some of the certifications that I completed, that expose my interest in the undertaken pursuit.

:large_blue_circle: Now, let me take you through some of the projects that I did while exploring the domain of data science.	:flashlight:

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
- **Data visualization using Tableau**: 
Analyzing US Sustainable Development Goals(SDG) from 2011-2017. Please find my project [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rashmi8121/viz/USSDGindicatorsDashboard/Final_Dashboard1)

  :checkered_flag: The goal of this project is to visualize how SDG indicators such as school expenditure per state GDP, high school dropout rate and unemployment rate vary across the US for the given period. The analysis of SDG is also done for each state and by gender/race. 

  :mag: The skill I acquired doing the project is to use Tableau to make simple, yet meaningful dashboard to analyze a few important aspects of the US economy. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- **ETL using Python, Docker, SQL**
Please find my project [here](https://github.com/Rashmi-PP/Data-ETL-pipeline-Python-AWS)

  :checkered_flag: The goal of this project is to do the following:
    1. Build an ETL pipeline where data is ingested to AWS S3
    2. Pre-process the data using Python
    3. Feed the resulting data to Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS)
    4. Connect DBeaver to RDS so I could execute queries on the database to make useful analysis
    5. Create AWS EC2 instance to host the application
    6. Run a cron job to get updated data to S3 repeatedly

  :mag: The skill I acquired doing this project is to learn the implementation of an end-to-end ETL pipeline. This is a skillset needed in every business.

- **Classification using Machine Learning in Python**
Please find my project [here](https://github.com/Rashmi-PP/MachineLearning_Classification)

  :checkered_flag: The goal of this project is to find out a good ML classification model to classify whether a person would subscribe to a term deposit based on various input features like personal demographics, loan amount, to name a few. The models implemented include logistic regression, support vector machine and neural network. These models were evaluated using metrics like recall, F1 score and accuracy. 

  :mag: The skills I acquired doing this project includes the following:
  1. Mitigation of class imbalance using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)
  2. Application of L1/L2/ElasticNet regularization, cross validation method to mitigate overfitting
  3. Model validation using metrics like recall, F1 score
  4. Overcoming underfitting by not eliminating too many features that originally caused overfitting.

- **Web development using Flask framework**
Please find my project [here](https://github.com/Rashmi-PP/Web-development-using-Flask) .
You can view the website [here]( https://exam-results.onrender.com/)

:checkered_flag: The goal of this project is to develop a simple web application using Flask and HTML to calculate an exam result status based on scores that a user inputs. On submission of the scores, a web page containing the result status and percentage score is rendered.

:mag: The skill I acquired implementing this project is to use Flask framework to build a web application that renders results dynamically.
